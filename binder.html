      <main><p>In an attempt to get over a case of <a href=https://twitter.com/NanaOAdane/status/1484731437265920004?s=20>coder's blog</a>, I built myself a static generator. It's called <strong>binder</strong>
. <em>It's what generated what you're reading now.</em>
</p>
<p>It was inpired by stuff others have built like <a href=https://github.com/XXIIVV/oscean>oscean</a> is used to generate <a href=https://wiki.xxiivv.com>the XXIIVV wiki</a> and a similar <a href=https:github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co>tool</a> used to generate the <a href=http://100r.co>Hundredrabbits' site</a>. It aims to be a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex>memex</a> (memory extension) or wiki generator as the former example is.</p>
<p>It is something I had wanted to build for a while now. It was really fun building out a parser for a markup language, inspired to markdown, called <code>bndr</code>
. The language spec can be <a href=https://github.com/v3rse/binder#bndr-markup>found here</a></p>
<p>I look forward to write a lot more using this tool while also refining its functionality over time. It has replaced the use of <a href=https://hexo.io/>hexo</a> on this site and is aimed at being very simple.</p>
<p>You can find <strong>binder</strong>
 <a href=https://github.com/v3rse/binder>here</a></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: it's not fit for human consumption. don't use it!</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Happy Coding</strong>
